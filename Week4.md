During the Mapathon, I decided to attend the class about using R for GIS. I actually thought it would only be about transforming variables in a dataframe to create a shapefile to import into GIS. Though that was a part of it, we also looked at how to plot/make maps inside R using some new packages. I really appreciated the way the class was set up from literally Step 0 - downloading RStudio, walking everyone through the way R functions, and giving clear explanations in the comments between the units of each mini-lesson. I got lost a little bit in the middle but found a bunch of resources on YouTube for further practice. Overall, I give the instructor a big thumb's up and am looking forward to trying it out again.
