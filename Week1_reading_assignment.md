The Elwha River is a watershed system of 75 miles found on the ancestral land of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, what settlers call the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. In 2014, after 100 years in existence, two dams on the lower Elwha River were permanently removed. This project was the largest dam removal and river restoration project in the world. For the last 6 years, Elwha fishery scientists and ecologists, along with Washington geologists and hydrologists, have had the opportunity to track the ecological and geological changes along the Elwha River. The removal has restored access for salmon to 70 miles of spawning grounds above the dams and, conversely, sediment typically contained by the dams is washing out and transforming the Elwha River delta. 

The Elwha River restoration is a fascinating study because it highlights the question of how to track rapid ecosystem changes that are subject to seasonal changes. As a result of the dam removal, native salmon have returned to the river and their salmon runs have become the largest on the Washington Coast, predators are feeding from the salmon runs, which changes their habitat range and deposits nutrients to the rainforest, the Elwha River Delta is re-forming and literally creating land, and, as climate change advances, the Elwha Glacier will melt and cause glaciation, which will increase the rates of flooding and sediment deposition on the Elwha River. All of this means that the team monitoring the changes on the Elwha need an understanding of how ecology, geology, and geography intersect. As they track these changes and make predictive models, they are also drawing conclusions about the economic benefit of dam removal and producing a framework for other governments to remove their own dams to restore rivers. It is FASCINATING. I will probably never get the chance to work with in vivo data, it all tends to be 2, 5, or 10 years old and reproduced from set parameters. In contrast, this project is defining the necessary paramaters as they are observed to be relevant. It makes me wonder if I should experiment with previously undervalued, or previously irrelevant attributes to determine if they contribute more to today's travel behavior than institutions believe.
