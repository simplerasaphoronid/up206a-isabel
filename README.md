**About Me**

I'm Isabel. I made a github account over the summer when I was using R to analyze NHTS data for a research project. The name references how life would be simpler as a phoronid, a marine worm, instead of a graduate student working in RStudio. 

**Class, Goals, Potential Projects**

Currently, I'm a 2nd Year in Urban Planning and I'm focusing on Transportation Policy and Plannning. I have always wanted to learn Python and mapping skills so I'm excited and a little nervous for this class. I am hoping to be able to apply these learnings to reports in other classes, public outreach, open-source mapping like QGIS and others. 
I have used ENVI for spatial analysis of land use before and I knew about GIS back then but not the foundations of spaital analysis. I don't have any ideas for a project but I could apply the work to the community collaborative coming up, which is about the Southern California region, COVID-19, and unions. I could also work on a project about food insecurity and/or unemployment. I'm also very interested in geographic access to medical care so a map about the routes to primary care, their cost, and travel duration sounds interesting.
