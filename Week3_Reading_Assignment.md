The paper presenting OSMnx went right over my head in the first section. It was intimidating to read about dual graphs when I had such a tenuous grasp on the primal graphs. However, I remember a data presentation from last winter that did explain how intersections are nodes and street segments are edges. The 2016 paper was not easy to read so I looked up Geoff Boeing on YouTube after reading it and got more insight on how specific things in OSMnx are significant. Foremost is how easy it sounds to use despite its complexity. That was already described in the index of the methods paper but Geoff's explanation on video was also incredibly simple. It was exciting to read that this package lets you conduct spatial analysis in three dimensions, which is something I always wondered about. My basic familiarity with GIS suggested most things are analyzed in 2 dimensions and topographical variation is ignored. With OSMnx, you can download elevation data and look at how vulnerable a section of a city may be to flooding from extreme weather events or from sea-level rise. 

In the second paper, Boeing discusses the historical changes of spatial ordering in US cities and how they can be analyzed using OSMnx. The polar histogram visual was very interesting, especially since you can look at changes as you move forward in time. It looks like younger cities, or old cities that had a chance to change their grid, aligned to true North more often than the oldest cities in the country. I have heard of Boston's notoriously varied street grid but never understood the extend until looking at Boeing's histogram. It is interesting to look at how disinvestment from cities aligned with development of circuitous routes until the 90s when it became important to revive our cities. At this point, the drive to have cities functional at the ground level through dining, shopping, mixed-use buildings, and dense city planning has matched a decline in vehicle ownership in certain areas. I am curious about who has reproduced this study in other cities and countries that experienced significant change in the 20th century like Berlin, Germany, formerly Soviet countries, and a place that underwent a population boom, like India. I am also incredibly impressed that Geoff Boeing created OSMnx in about 1 year?! He says he started working on it in 2016 and introduces it in a paper a year later. I know it's a combination of existing resources but I still think making something like this is incredibly impressive. I am also excited this is open-source because I'd like to use it someday.
