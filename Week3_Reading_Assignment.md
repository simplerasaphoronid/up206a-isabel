Next week, we will have our second guest speaker Geoff Beoing for the class. Here, I present two of his readings. One introduces you to OSMNX, a python module he built for the purposes of allowing network analysis with Open Street Map data. I also list his latest paper, which looks at the evolution of American street network design, and how the use of data science tools can inform our perspective and knowledge on the evolution of urban networks.

Create a markdown file in your repo titled Week3_Reading_Assignment.md
Write a one-two paragraph reaction to the readings. What spoke to you, and how does it inform your approach to your own research?
Provide at least two comments or questions you would like to ask the author.
