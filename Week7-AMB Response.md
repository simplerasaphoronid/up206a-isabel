Adam Miller-Ball is coming for Donald Shoup in the 2020 paper "Parking search caused congestion: Whereâ€™s all the fuss?"

In this paper about new transportation research methods, the authors dethrone previous research that estimated 30% of urban traffic comes from people searching for parking (Shoup). They point out the faults in this reasoning 1) extrapolating from counts done in downtown areas and 2) a lot of prior studies estimated and assumed a lot about people searching for parking. Instead, this paper explores a new method for determining how many people are looking for parking and how much excess travel, time, pollution, and irritation is being incurred. In addition to cost, planners have also assumed that these conditions increase risk of accidents and economic competitiveness at destinations where parking is hard to find. The paper finds that cruising/parking search accounts for 1% of vehicle travel in Ann Arbor and San Francisco. It appears most people can find an acceptable parking spot near their destination while a much smaller number of people drive around and around looking for parking. When it comes to excess travel, cruising does not seem to be a big factor. Instead, pick-ups, drop-offs, confusing streets, traffic, driving erros, and routine or convenience are all better explanations for why there is more vehicle travel at the end of a trip. When I first moved to LA, someone told me that parking and traffic wouldn't be such an issue if it wasn't for Uber drivers. Maybe that's true.

**Questions for Adam:**
1) Is it possible to use this method on other driving conditions (like drive-thrus, pick-up/drop-off) to estimate traffic emissions from excess travel?
2) Does an ideal data set exist to answer your questions about parking, excess travel, etc?
